# Personal Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive personal portfolio website built with React.js to showcase my professional profile, projects, technical skills, certifications, and resume.

## 👤 About Me
I’m a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer who thrives on turning raw data into actionable insights and intelligent systems. Throughout my journey, I’ve refined my ability to bridge the gap between complex datasets and real-world solutions, focusing on building models that are both accurate and scalable.

I’m proficient in **Python, SQL, R, Pandas, NumPy, and React.js** — and I enjoy the **integration** of developing powerful back-end models while ensuring the results are accessible through intuitive interfaces.

My key areas of interest include **Predictive Modeling, Artificial Intelligence,** and exploring the intersection of **Machine Learning and Data Visualization** to tell a compelling story with data.
